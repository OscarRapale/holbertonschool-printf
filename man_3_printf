.SH DESCRIPTION
The printf() function formats and prints data to the standard output, stdout. It mimics the behavior of the printf function in C programming. This command is particularly useful for formatted output in various programming and scripting tasks.

.TP
\r{
.TP
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
.TP
    printf("The value of pi is approximately: %.2f\n", 3.14);
.TP
    printf("Address of a variable: %p\n", &variable);
.TP
    return 0;
.TP
\r}

.SH NOTES
Remember to include <stdio.h> header file for printf() function to work properly in your C program.
